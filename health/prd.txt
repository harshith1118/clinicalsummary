1) Problem

Doctors/nurses waste time reading long medical notes.
So they need a tool that quickly summarizes and gives next actions.

2) Solution (What we are building)

MediSummary is a web app that uses Gemini 3 API to:

Summarize any clinical/healthcare note

Make a simple checklist of next steps

Convert the same note into patient-friendly explanation

✅ It supports doctors + patients
✅ It improves efficiency and understanding
✅ It’s safe because it does not diagnose

3) Users

Primary Users

Doctors

Nurses / Hospital staff

Secondary Users

Patients (only for explanation mode)

4) MVP Features (Only 3 features)
Feature 1: Quick Summary

Input: clinical note text
Output:

5 bullet summary

1 short paragraph summary

Feature 2: Action Checklist

Output:

Follow-up tasks

Tests mentioned

Medicines mentioned

Any missing info like:

Allergies not mentioned

Follow-up date not mentioned

Feature 3: Patient Explanation
