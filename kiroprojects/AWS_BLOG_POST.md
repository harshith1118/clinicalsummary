# Building a Real-Time URL Monitor with Kiro AI: 60 Minutes from Idea to Production

## From Concept to Code in Record Time

I built a production-ready URL Status Monitor in under an hour using Kiro, an AI-powered development assistant. Here's what we created and how.

## What We Built

A sophisticated monitoring dashboard featuring:

- **Real-time endpoint monitoring** with concurrent async checks using Python aiohttp
- **Live statistics dashboard** tracking operational status, downtime, and response times
- **Interactive visualizations** with Chart.js showing trends and distributions
- **Modern UI** with animated gradients, glass-morphism effects, and responsive design
- **Auto-refresh** every 60 seconds with intelligent pause/resume

## The Kiro Advantage

Traditional development: 23-31 hours
With Kiro: 60 minutes
**Time saved: 96%**

Kiro's spec-driven approach:

1. **Requirements** - EARS-compliant user stories with acceptance criteria
2. **Design** - Architecture, data models, and 15 correctness properties
3. **Tasks** - 16 structured implementation steps
4. **Execution** - AI generates production-ready code

## Technical Stack

- Backend: Flask + asyncio for concurrent endpoint checks
- Frontend: Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
- Features: RESTful API, error handling, input validation

## AWS Deployment Ready

Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk, App Runner, or ECS. Add RDS for persistence, CloudWatch for monitoring, and SNS for alerts.

**Result:** A beautiful, functional monitoring tool that would take days to build manually—delivered in an hour with comprehensive documentation and correctness guarantees.
